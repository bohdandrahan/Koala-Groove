# KoalaGroove

*KoalaGroove* is a simple yet powerful looper pedal application designed for guitarists and musicians of all levels. Inspired by the lack of accessible and intuitive loop pedal tools online, *KoalaGroove* aims to provide a user-friendly experience for practicing, jamming, and creating music.

## Vision

The project envisions two primary approaches to looping:

### Timer-Triggered Loop

The *Timer-Triggered Loop* functionality offers a comprehensive toolset for musicians who prefer structured practice sessions. Users can set up time signatures, BPM, and the number of measures to create precise looping sequences. Visual cues, including a countdown timer and metronome, assist users in recording and playing back their loops with accuracy. Advanced features such as segment selection for playback provide flexibility in practice routines.
