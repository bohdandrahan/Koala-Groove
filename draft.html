        <p>This is a project where I hope to implement simple looper pedal. <br>
            I was hoping to find some app online for my guitar practice and I was surprised not to find what I was
            looking
            for, not even behind a paywall.
            So I desiced to write my own tool. <br>
            I'm not professional musician and never saw a real looper pedal or any professional set up for this
            purposein my life so I'm not even sure what exactly
            the
            standart functionality there is.
            But on the other hand I have a clear vision for what are my personal needs are, with maybe few bells and
            whistels down the line.
            There are two approaches I see for this tool:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Timer triggered loop</li>
            <li>Loop by push of a button</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4> Time Trigerred Loop</h4><br>
        This is probably more functional loop tool, but it will require way more sophisticated knowlege in music theory.
        <br>
        It would probaly have to be tied to metronome, there should be some sort of set up for time signature.
        The way I see should look something like this:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>I set up time signature, let's say 4/4 by default</li>
            <li>I set up BPM, let's say 90</li>
            <li>I set up the number of measures(or bars). Let's say 5</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to set up timer before start, but this is optional, I can see 5 sec being default</li>
            <li>I click "Start rectording"</li>
            <li>I see a 5 second countdown, perhaps nicely visualised by a circle</li>
            <li>When countdown stops, the recording begins</li>
            <li>There should be visual cues where we are in the bar</li>
            <li>Visual metronome sould be there as well tied to the bars</li>
            <li>whenever the times ends, there should appear "Play/Pause" button and "Delete" button</li>
            <li>Play would start the loop</li>
            <li>Cool feature would be to be able to select a segment to play, let's say play just one selected bar, or
                selected custom range</li>
            <li>to be continued</li>
        </ul>
        Next time you are here, finish with your thoughts on Timer Looper, and write your vision for Button Looper.
        Don't forget to think about multiple tracks.
